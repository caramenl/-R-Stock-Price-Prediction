# -R-Stock-Price-Prediction

comprehensive analysis and forecasting of Apple Inc. stock prices (any stock price can be analyze and forecasted)

What it does
Time Series Analysis:
- Calculates log returns for the stock prices: computes the percentage change in stock prices using logarithms to stabilize variance and make the series more stationary, which is essential for accurate modeling
- Analyzes autocorrelation (ACF and PACF): measures the correlation between the stock price series and its lags to identify the strength of relationships at different lags.
- Performs Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity: determines the correlation between the series and its lags after removing the effects of shorter lags, helping to identify the appropriate AR (AutoRegressive) terms for modeling | tests the null hypothesis that the series has a unit root, which indicates non-stationarity. A rejection of the null hypothesis suggests that the series is stationary and suitable for further modeling.

Forecasting:
- Fits an ARIMA model to the log returns : utomatically selects the best ARIMA model parameters (p, d, q) based on the historical log return data. ARIMA models are used to forecast future values in time series data by incorporating autoregression, differencing, and moving averages
- Makes predictions and evaluates the model’s accuracy
- Analyzes sentiments from tweets about Apple using rtweet and sentiment dictionaries
- Performs cross-validation for the ARIMA model : Evaluates the ARIMA model’s performance through cross-validation to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting. This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets multiple times to validate the model’s accuracy and reliability

Machine Learning:
- Defines and trains an LSTM model using Keras : Constructs an LSTM neural network model using Keras. LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them suitable for time series forecasting
- Predicts future prices with the LSTM model
